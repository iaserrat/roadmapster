# Roadmapster

## Motivation

[Wizeline Roadmap](https://www.wizelineroadmap.com) is an excellent SaSS for fast, free (at the moment) and agile way to create beautiful roadmaps. This project is aimed to extend it's functionality by providing a way to create roadmap items based on any Github issue.

## Disclaimer

This project is developed outside of Wizeline Inc. by using publicly accessible API's. There's no employment connection, payment involved or any legal tie in any form by the supporters of the project and Wizeline Inc.

## Installation

For now the easiest way to install is to `git clone git@github.com:iaserrat/roadmapster.git`

## Usage

- First clone and install the required dependencies:

```
$ git clone git@github.com:iaserrat/roadmapster.git
$ cd roadmapster && bundle install
```

- Login to [Wizeline Roadmap](https://www.wizelineroadmap.com) and create a regular user with a strong password. At this time Wizeline Roadmap doesn't support integration tokens, so you'll need to use a regular account to authenticate API requests. Create an user just for this.

- Once you have your user, deploy roadmapster to your favourite cloud and create the following environment variables:

```
WIZELINE_EMAIL='themailyoucreatedtheaccountwith@example.com
WIZELINE_PASSWORD='asupersecurepassword'
```

- Run roadmapster with `rake`

- Create a Webhook in your Github repository that sends **only** issues events pointing to your roadmapster server.

- Start tracking issues!

### How to track an issue on Wizeline?

Create an issue and put somewhere on the description the following tracker string:

`[ROADMAP/<your_organization_name>/<roadmap_name>]`

Replace the values accordingly. Make sure the organization and roadmap name exist and they're typed correctly.

We encourage you to put an issue template with the according organization and roadmap names so it's easily to start tracking your issues :)

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bundle install` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

### Regarding tests

Please record all Wizeline API interactions with VCR.
